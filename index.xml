It’s aimed at enthusiasts who want a better way to log their plants progress, track changes, and maybe learn from their own growing history.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, I’ll walk you through how I set up the server structure to run GrowLyst. Keep in mind, this is still pre-production and things might change as I go along.
It’s also my first real project so I’m expecting a few mistakes along the way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://franzhenrymueller.de/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://franzhenrymueller.de/about/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="about-me">

&lt;p>Hi, I’m Franz Müller. I’m based in Würzburg, Germany, and work at Yaveon, where I specialize in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. Within the company, I’m part of the team that develops our in-house apps and also help explore ways to integrate AI, both into our products and for internal use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Outside of work, I’m currently building GrowLyst, a personal project developed in Python with Django. You can learn more about it in the “Projects” section of this site.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://franzhenrymueller.de/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://franzhenrymueller.de/contact/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="contact">

&lt;p>GrowLyst is a platform that allows users to manage their plant grows. They can track everything from seed to storage and trying the produce.
There also is an additional social media component that allows users to share their grow progress with others on the website. The goal is to
address enthusiasts who like to show their results and display them in style. The premium tier allows users to gain deep insights into their
grows via statistics, graphs and formulas that make recommendations and allow comparrision between different plants, even from other users.
A mobile app is planned as well but the Webapp has higher priority.
Please refer to my &lt;a href="https://franzhenrymueller.de/series/growlyst/" >blog posts&lt;/a> for further information about techniques I used and my experiences with GrowLyst.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
