# About Me

Hi, I’m Franz Müller. I’m based in Würzburg, Germany, and work at Yaveon, where I specialize in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central. Within the company, I’m part of the team that develops our in-house apps and also help explore ways to integrate AI, both into our products and for internal use.

Outside of work, I’m currently building GrowLyst, a personal project developed in Python with Django. You can learn more about it in the “Projects” section of this site.

In my free time, I like to stay active at the gym, enjoy the occasional gaming session, and spend quality time with my girlfriend.
