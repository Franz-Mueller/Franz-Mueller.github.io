GrowLyst is my project that helps people who grow plants to manage their grows. It aims to address enthusiasts.
In this article you will read about how I sat up my server sturcture to run GrowLyst. Keep in mind this is pre production and can change.
GrowLyst is my first "real" project. So mistakes are expected.
