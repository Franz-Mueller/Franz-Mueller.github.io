## GrowLyst (work in progress)

GrowLyst is a platform that allows users to manage their plant grows. They can track everything from seed to storage and trying the produce.
There also is an additional social media component that allows users to share their grow progress with others on the website. The goal is to
address enthusiasts who like to show their results and display them in style. The premium tier allows users to gain deep insights into their
grows via statistics, graphs and formulas that make recommendations and allow comparrision between different plants, even from other users.
Please refer to my [blog posts]({{< relref "categories/growlyst" >}}) for further information about techniques I used and my experiences with GrowLyst.
